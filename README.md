# FacialRecognition

This is the repository for QEA I final project, a facial recognition algorithm. The program utilizes three different algorithms for this project, and can create a data base based on a training set given to it, and then match images with the same lighting conditions to the data base with 90% accuracy. For diffferent lighting conditions, it can do it with 15% accuracy.

To run, simply download the repository and open up any of three MATLAB files, and click run. To input your own images, put your own images into a data set, and use the load command to use them in the code.

To understand more what this project is about, feel free to read my Paper on it, FacialRecognitionFinal.
